Read_Only_Instructions=Read only has updating and deleting functionality disabled.  Return to the index page to switch modes.

Auth_Limitations=The login functionality does not work well with the eclipse browser.  Please use FF or Chrome.
DB_Page_Instructions_Title=The DB
Primary_Key_Instructions=The primary key is a guid that is not visible or editable from the UI. The batch number is not a primary key because I sometimes split a batch and ferment with different yeast, as such my spread sheet has muliple rows with the same number.

Create_Instructions=To drop, recreate the DB and populate with test data, run DataManager.java as Java Application.
Reload_Limitation=Reloading the table page can cause bad things to happen. Please bounce the server if this occurs
