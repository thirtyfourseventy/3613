Read_Write_Access=Click here to login
Instructions_Title=How To Use
Index_Page_Instructions_Title=This Page
Read_Write_Auth_Instructions=To sign in with read/write privileges use password, "java3613".  This will decrypt the db properties file in WEB-INF allowing reading, updating and deleting from the DB
DB_Page_Instructions_Title=The Database
Primary_Key_Instructions=The primary key is a guid that is not visible or editable from the UI. The batch number is not a primary key because I sometimes split a batch and ferment with different yeast, as such my spread sheet has muliple rows with the same number.  
ABV_Instructions=The ABV column is not editable as Alcohol by Volume is calculated based on the Original and Final Gravities.
Create_Instructions=To drop, recreate the DB and populate with test data, run DataManager.java as Java Application (note this does not use the encrypted properties file).
Reload_Limitation=Reloading the table page can cause bad things to happen. Please bounce the server if this occurs
